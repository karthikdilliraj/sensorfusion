# Introduction

SensorFusion is a software that measures sensor data from different sensors in order to assure precise estimates of value. It applies the sensor fusion algorithm to calculate the fused output.

# Requirement

Software needs to calculate and store fused value provided by the algorithm for the input csv file which contains the sensor data from different sensors and timestamp.

# Assumption

- User can specify the range of valid sensor data to run the algorithm.
- User can specify the stuck time interval to calculate the fused output for a particular timeframe.
- User can specify the Parameter p and Support q value for the calculation.

# Program Flow

The program flow for the application is as follows:
