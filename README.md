# SensorFusion

SensorFusion is a software that measures sensor data from different sensors in order to assure precise estimates of value.

SensorFusion implements the algorithm described in:

G. Hongyan, “A simple multi-sensor data fusion algorithm based on principal component analysis,” in 2009 ISECS International Colloquium on Computing, Communication, Control, and Management, Sanya, China, 2009, pp. 423–426.
